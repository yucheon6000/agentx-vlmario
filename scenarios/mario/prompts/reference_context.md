The following is an example of a map video and its corresponding evaluation response with a reference score of [REFERENCE_SCORE]/20. 
{
"explain": "This map is a straightforward stage that utilizes classic elements from Super Mario Bros. The player starts at the beginning point and proceeds through familiar terrain such as stairs, pipes, and flat ground while encountering basic enemies like Goombas. Question blocks are placed throughout the level, and the final objective is to reach the flagpole at the end. Overall, the map resembles an early-stage level from the original game.",
"result": {
"composition": {
"score": 7,
"reason": "All essential components required to clear the map—starting point, platforms, enemies, item blocks, and the final goal flag—are fully included without any missing elements."
},
"probability": {
"score": 3,
"reason": "Most structures, such as floating blocks and staircase formations, generally follow the rules and physics of the original Super Mario Bros. However, some placements—like pipes floating in midair or pipes sitting directly on top of question blocks—are not physically plausible within the game’s rules."
},
"completeness": {
"score": 5,
"reason": "The placement of enemies and item blocks requires the player to make basic strategic decisions such as adjusting jump timing and choosing whether to obtain items. However, the overall structure is simple and linear, offering limited opportunities for deeper or more varied decision-making."
},
"aesthetics": {
"score": 4,
"reason": "While the map is functionally solid, it lacks a distinct theme or creative visual arrangement. The heavy reliance on basic blocks makes the level appear somewhat plain and repetitive."
},
"originality": {
"score": 3,
"reason": "Although a few mildly unique structures appear, the overall layout and elements rely heavily on very common patterns found in typical Super Mario Bros. levels, leaving little room for originality or creative ideas."
},
"fairness": {
"score": 7,
"reason": "All obstacles and enemies are clearly visible to the player, and there are no sudden or unpredictable hazards. The placements are reasonable and maintain a strong sense of fairness."
},
"fun": {
"score": 4,
"reason": "The map provides the familiar enjoyment of classic Mario gameplay and has a stable overall composition. However, the lack of originality may make it less engaging for experienced players seeking new or exciting experiences."
},
"humanity": {
"score": 4,
"reason": "Overall, the level appears to be designed by a human, but some unnatural structure placements and low probability coherence may suggest AI involvement."
},
"difficulty": {
"score": 2,
"reason": "The map contains no unfair or challenging structures, resulting in an overall easy difficulty level."
}
},
"score": 12
